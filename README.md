# employee-tracker

## Description

This application allows the user to view and update information from their company's database. Once initialized, the application will provide the user with a handful of options, including the options to either view or update the departments, roles, or employees (and their roles) in the database by answering questions within the command line. 

## Packages Used

[Inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer/v/8.2.4) - Used to prompt the user with questions/choices and handle responses<br>
[MySQL2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql2) - Used to establish a connection between the server and the database<br>
[Console.table](https://www.npmjs.com/package/console.table) - Used to neatly display information from the database in the command line<br>


## Future Improvements

-Better organize the files associated with this project. Specifically, consolidate the queries used into their own js file.<br>
-Use fewer functions by properly chaining promises together.
